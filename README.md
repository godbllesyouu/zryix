# Zyrix — Crypto Community (Figma → Code Starter)

This is a clean, responsive starter mapped to your Figma structure. Replace copy, colors, and assets to match the exact design.

## Files
- `index.html` — semantic structure based on common crypto landing sections.
- `styles.css` — variables + responsive layout. Map `:root` colors to your Figma Styles.
- `script.js` — mobile nav toggle, dynamic year.
- `assets/img/logo.svg`, `assets/img/hero-chart.png` — placeholders.

## How to customize
1. **Colors & radii** — edit CSS variables in `:root`.
2. **Typography** — preload your font (put `.woff2` in `assets/fonts/` and update `<link rel="preload">`).
3. **Sections** — copy/paste blocks to match more sections from Figma (team, FAQ, partners, etc.).
4. **Icons** — swap emojis for SVG icons from your Figma export.
5. **Images** — replace placeholder images in `assets/img/` with your exports.

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in a browser, or use a simple server:
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8080
```

## Deploy
- GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel — just drag & drop the folder.
